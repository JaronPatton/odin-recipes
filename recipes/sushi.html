  <h2>A typical sushi lunch.</h2>
  <p>Sushi is vinegared rice with raw fish. However, raw fish does not always have to be included, as there's a wide
    variety.
    The fish is wrapped in seaweed. I like to dip the more basic of sushi / sashimi into '<em>Yum Yum</em>' sauce and
    soy sauce. One has to prepare carefully when using raw fish.
